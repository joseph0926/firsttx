# FirstTx Overview

FirstTx is a three-layer toolkit for React 19 + CSR apps that tackles
**revisit speed, offline resilience, and optimistic UI** all at once.

- **Prepaint** - Captures the last screen as a DOM snapshot and restores it before React mounts on revisits.
- **Local-First** - Treats IndexedDB as the single source of truth and automates server sync.
- **Tx** - Wraps UI updates and server calls in transactions that can safely roll back on failure.

## What problems does it focus on?

In typical CSR apps:

- First visits can be optimized with SSR or skeleton UIs,
- but **revisits, tabbing around, and back navigation** often show 1-2 seconds of blank screen or a loading spinner.
- With flaky networks or offline usage, optimistic UIs can leave the screen in a **half-rolled-back** state.

FirstTx addresses this with three layers:

1. Use Prepaint to remember the last screen,
2. Use Local-First to keep a local model alive,
3. Use Tx to wrap UI changes in transactions.
